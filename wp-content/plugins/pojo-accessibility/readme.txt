The One Click Accessibility plugin is the fastest plugin to help you make your website more accessible.

== Description ==

The One Click Accessibility plugin is the fastest plugin to help you make your website more accessible.

**Please Note:** One Click Accessibility was initially developed for the Pojo framework, and now has been made compatible for any WordPress theme

While most accessibility issues canâ€™t be addressed without directly changing your content, One Click Accessibility adds a number of helpful accessibility features with the minimum amount of setup and without the need for expert knowledge.

**Accessibility Toolbar:**

Add a toolbar toggling hat allows you to set:

* Resize font (increase/decrease)
* Grayscale
* Negative Contrast
* High Contrast
* Light Background
* Links Underline
* Readable Font
* Link to Sitemap / Feedback / Help pages

**Accessibility Features:**

* Enable skip to content
* Add outline focus for focusable elements
* Remove the target attribute from links
* Add landmark roles to all links
* Customizer for style adjustment
